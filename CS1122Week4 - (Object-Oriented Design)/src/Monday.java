 * How do you decide what comprises an object?
 *
 * Look at the data and see how it is grouped. Things that are closely related go together in the same class.
 *
 * - Gather requirements
 * - Use CRC cards to find classes, responisbilites, and collaborators
 * - Use UML diagrams to record class relationships
 * - Use javadoc to document method behavior
 * - Implement your program
 *
 * Requirement specification
 * - A description of a software system to be developed It lays out functional and non-functional requirements,
 * and it may include a set of use cases that describe user interactions that the software must provide.
 * - Start the development proess by gathering and documenting program requirements
 * - Write down what your program should do in plain English
 * - Include typical use-case scenarios
 *
 * Discovering Methods
 * - To discover methods, look for the verbs in a problem description
 * - Transformations or processes that operate on an object's data are good candidates for methods
 * - Relationships between methods and classes are also a good way to determine things
