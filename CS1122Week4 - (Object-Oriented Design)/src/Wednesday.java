 * UML Diagrams:
 *
 * Discover relationships between classes
 * - Verbs often indicate a relationship between classes
 * - Not all verbs are actions words
 * - Relationships between verbs help us create the system
 *
 * Cohesion
 * - A Class should represent a single concept
 * - Shouldn't be any extraneous data
 * Interrelatedness of things
 * - Maximize cohesions
 * - Minimize coupling
 *
 * Coupling
 * - A class depends on another class if it uses objects of that class
 * Coupling is the degree to which a class is dependent on objects from other classes
 * - Minimize coupling because more dependencies means that there are more ways that things can go wrong
 *
 * Aggregation
 * - A class Aggregates another if its objects contain objects of the other class
 * - Aggregation is indicated by the "has-a" relationship
 *
 * Inheritance
 * - The relationship between a more general class (superclass) and its subclass. Arrow points towards the superclass
 *
 *
 * UML Diagrams
 * - UML Diagrams show relationships between classes using a class diagram
 * - Indicate attributes and methods in the diagrams
 * - Attributes are public variables
 * - Methods are public methods
